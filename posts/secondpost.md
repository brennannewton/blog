## Backend: Critiques Feature

My major focus this week was working on the main feature of our website, critiques. Specifically, CJ & I worked on designing and implementing the backend architecture for the critiques feature. We started by designing the MVC pattern. First, we created new routes for the critiques feature. Because we already had a router for user registration, we had to implement a meta router to organize all the routes. This ended up being a more difficult task than we expected, so we had to ask Scott & other teams for help. Once the meta router was working, we moved on to writing the controller functions. We encountered a roadblock when we tried to implement uploading, so we did some reasearch to see if we could figure it out. This turned out to only highlight more problems.

## Project Management

One thing I learned from stumbling through this week was the importance of scope. While it's important to have goals for your project, it's more important to actually be able to implement the project. At the end of the week, we sat down as a team and decided to scale back our expectations. This alleviated some of the stress we were all expereiencing, and we now have clarity moving forward.
